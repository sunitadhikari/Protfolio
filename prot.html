               <br>
                I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night.
                <br>
                <br>
                Talking about my hobby is that i love music and love to sing which gives me a relief from every aspect also i love make new variety of foods. I like to laugh too.
